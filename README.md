### Healthcare Features:
- **Fall Detection for Elderly & At-risk Patients**:
  - If a fall is detected, the device begins *beeping for 7 seconds*.
  - If the patient *responds*, the alert is canceled.
  - If there’s *no response*:
    - The app instantly sends the *GPS location* to the healthcare dashboard.
    - *Calls and messages* are triggered to the patient’s emergency contacts or healthcare providers.

- **Manual Health Emergency Trigger**:
  - Patients can manually request help for sudden health conditions (e.g., heart attack, seizures) via the app.

## 2. Real-Time Medical Mapping

Upon receiving a medical alert, the *Mapping Section* activates to visualize health emergencies on a map.

### Features:
1. **Live GPS Tracking**:
   - Accurately maps the patient’s location for responders.
2. **Population Density Thresholding**:
   - In high-density areas (e.g., hospitals, elderly care homes):
     - **Below threshold**: Standard emergency protocols are initiated.
     - **Above threshold**: Drone-based delivery and AI support are deployed for large-scale triage.

## 3. Drone-Powered Medical Response

Jatayu’s Drone Section ensures rapid delivery of medical aid and site assessment when ground response is delayed or limited.

### Functions:
1. **Autonomous Navigation**: Drones are deployed directly to patient locations.
2. **Medical Payload Delivery**: Supplies such as first-aid kits, oxygen, or essential medicines are dropped.
3. **Aerial Imaging for Triage**: Provides a visual overview of mass casualty or remote patient scenarios.
4. **Drone-Based Patient Assessment**: Equipped with sensors and cameras to assist in remote vitals monitoring and situational analysis.

## 4. AI-Driven Health Triage and Injury Detection

The *AI Section* intelligently analyzes drone feeds and mapping data to prioritize medical emergencies.

### Healthcare Features:
- **Human Presence Estimation**: Assesses the number of people affected.
- **Injury & Condition Detection**: Uses image recognition to classify medical urgency:
  - *a. Normal* (minor injuries, low risk)
  - *b. Intermediate* (needs medical attention)
  - *c. Severe* (life-threatening, needs immediate help)
- **Triage Heatmaps**: Highlights areas requiring urgent medical care.
- **Ambulance Routing**: AI calculates and suggests *shortest paths* for emergency medical teams.
- **Hospital & Government Alerts**: Notifies hospitals, clinics, and health departments for coordinated response and resource allocation.
